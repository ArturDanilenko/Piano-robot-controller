# Piano-robot-controller
A project that combines aspects of computer, electrical and mechanical engineering and forms a robot that is able to execute a series of movements resembling playing piano. 
The code that interfaces with electrical outputs is written in C++ and acts as a PID controller. It is responsible for regulating the direction, speed, and position of the attached motors. 
The input parameters are collected at a web page connected to a server running on an Atheros chip allowing the user to remotely control the robot given the appropriate credentials.
